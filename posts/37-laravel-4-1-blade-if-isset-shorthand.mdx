Laravel 4.1 introduces a new shorthand for echoing out data in Blade, which is really nice.

```blade
{{ $variable or 'default' }}
```

This shorthand actually expands out to a full `isset` call on the variable and returns the default value if false.

```php
isset($variable) ? $variable : 'default'
```

So if you're not sure if something is going to appear in the view or not, here's a nice way to test!
