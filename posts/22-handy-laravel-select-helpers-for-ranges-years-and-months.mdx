Came across some groovy form helpers in Laravel that aren't currently documented (though I have made a [pull request](https://github.com/laravel/docs/pull/458)) which are actually pretty handy.

## Select list with a range

```php
echo Form::selectRange('number', 10, 20);
```

## Select list with a year range

```php
echo Form::selectYear('year', 1900, 2000);
```

## Select list with month names

```php
echo Form::selectMonth('month');
```
