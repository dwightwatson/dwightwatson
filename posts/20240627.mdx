While building [phonable](https://github.com/roomies-com/phonable) I wanted to support multiple services like Prelude and Vonage simultaneously - to match how we used those services on [Roomies](https://www.roomies.com). To do this I used the default [`Manager` class](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/11.x/src/Illuminate/Support/Manager.php) that comes with Laravel. It provides a similar interface to abstractions Laravel provides around caching systems databases and mail services.

One frustrating limitation of this `Manager` implementation is that by default it restricts you to a single instance of any connection. Without extending it in your own code you are limited to a single Prelude/Vonage/Twilio instance. I shipped and adopted the package internally anyway as it wasn't a showstopper but it is something I wanted to address.

## The Solution: MultipleInstanceManager

[Newton Job pointed out on X](https://x.com/_newtonjob/status/1762532906910482793) that Laravel has a [`MultipleInstanceManager`](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/11.x/src/Illuminate/Support/MultipleInstanceManager.php) class. This class provides everything I needed to allow for multiple instances of drivers.

I implemented the required changes in [a relatively simple PR](https://github.com/roomies-com/phonable/pull/3).

## Key Aspects of MultipleInstanceManager

Some interesting aspects of `MultipleInstanceManager` addressed in the PR include:

1. Managing the default instance name and allowing it to be changed at runtime.
2. Implementing `getInstanceConfig` to return the appropriate configuration for a given instance name. The `driver` key determines which method to call.
3. Manually binding the manager. `MultipleInstanceManager` requires an application instance though it isn't type-hinted.

```php
$this->app->bind(
    abstract: 'phone-verification',
    concrete: fn ($app) => new Verification\Manager($app),
);
```

Moving to `MultipleInstanceManager` required no breaking changes. It's a great base to take your manager implementation to the next level if you require it.
